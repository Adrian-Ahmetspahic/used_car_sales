# Used Car Price Analysis
Analysis of what drives pricing of used cars

### SUMMARY

This report analyzes used car sales data to identify the key factors that influence car pricing, helping you make smarter purchasing and pricing decisions.


### KEY FINDINGS

1. Year of the Car
    - Newer models significantly increase selling price
    - Price also seems to grow more quickly for recent years
    - Machine learning models value this as the driving factor for pricing

2. Odometer Reading
    - Lower mileage correlates strongly with higher sale price, with correlation graphs even showing that this is the main driving factor for pricing of cars

3. Manufacturer
    - Varying average prices of cars from different manufacturers where some are definitely more profitable

4. Location (State)
    - Prices very per state with each state having different average car price.
  

### RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Stock more Ram and GMC trucks: They offer the most profit of the top 10 most sold cars, and outperform all of the top 5 most sold cars in pricing
2. Maintain a balanced inventory: Ford, Jeep, and Chevrolet remain solid sellers with good value and outperform toyata and honda in the list of top 5 most sold cars
3. Target newer, lower mileage vehicles: Year and odometer reading are by far the strongest price indicators with machine learning models valuing more recent years highest.
4. Price Competetively Based on Region: Adjust pricing based on local state averages or delegate more stock to shops in states with higher averages.
